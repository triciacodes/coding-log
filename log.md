### Day 1: July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I restarted 100 days of code today. I was learning how to create 3D shapes with [Processing](https://processing.org/), and I came up with [this](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a) shimmery sort of gradient box, halfway through intention, and halfway through happy accident.

I also want to include some thoughts here about my [last round](https://github.com/tricialeach/100-days-of-code-tricia) of 100 days of code that I abandoned at the beginning of July. I think I wasn't successful at that round because the rules I had set for myself were too strict. I wasn't allowing myself to count class work for projects, so I had been coding for several hours or more, and was forcing myself to try to work on a CSS animation at the end of the day. In this round I'm going to count any coding, as long as it is on an actual project, and not time spent reading or watching tutorials.

I also found that trying to complete one animation a day on CodePen was too restrictive. I was working at a very surface level so that I was able to finish something and wrap it up with a pretty bow at the end of the day. By lifting the restriction to fully complete something every day, I'm hoping to be able to make some more complicated projects over a few days or longer.
