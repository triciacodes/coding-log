### October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the design draft for my personal portfolio website. Installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), updated Ruby, and installed [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install). Set up initial starter template for portfolio website, including Sass file. Tested to ensure it was working. This is what I need to use in terminal: $sass --watch --style expanded scss/styles.scss:styles/main.css

### October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the Friends of Graphic Design website again. The last version (started/stopped a year ago) utilized floats for layout, and wasn't fully completed. I stripped out the floats and converted to using Bootstrap for layout. After getting into the more creative aspects of the layout (photos that go off the side of page, backgrounds that are diagonal), I realized the way I'm using Bootstrap might not be the best setup for this layout. Additionally, it complicates the HTML with a lot of divs. And, it's unlikely that most students who will be updating the website will know Bootstrap. I'm trying to strike a compromise between creating this website quickly, and using technology that students with more limited knowledge will be able to update. Flexbox with great comments may be the way to go.

### September 4–6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on my last project for my Creative Coding class at PCC. We did presentations on Sept 7. I used the [Leap Motion for Processing](https://github.com/nok/leap-motion-processing) library to make the graphics responsive to hand motion and gestures. I also made each of the interactions available by using the keyboard.

### September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the problems in Codecademy's updated [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course. Some of the [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) are covered in this course, so some of this is new knowledge. Notably: let, const, arrow syntax.

### September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Restarting the challenge again. I've been steadily working on both JavaScript and Processing, but I haven't been consistently pushing work to Github. I haven't found a good way to post my Processing sketches online without resorting to using gifs. I may switch to using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) so that I can publish the sketches on my website. Today I worked on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) 30 Days of Code challenges, and the todo list exercise from the [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com) course. I'm happy to report that I'm able to work ahead somewhat within each section. After I finish working through the tutorial, I'm planning on trying to duplicate the project independently.

### July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was learning how to create 3D shapes with [Processing](https://processing.org/), and I came up with [this](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a) shimmery sort of gradient box, halfway through intention, and halfway through happy accident.

### July 4, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/full/MoXEXX/), trying out clipping in CSS. Sort of a minimal petri dish with CSS animation. I also made good progress on a [project](https://github.com/tricialeach/lc101-user-signup) for LaunchCode.

**Thoughts:** No deep thoughts tonight. Just happy to add another css trick to my bag.

### July 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I didn't make progress on personal projects, but I worked for around 4–5 hours on a [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/lc101) project. I was on a roll, and wanted to keep on going instead of breaking to work on a CodePen. I'm working on a user sign-up form with Python and Flask, that needs to have multiple validation points. I've decided I don't want to count days like these to my 100 Days of Code challenge, but I do want to give myself a break if I've worked at least a couple of hours on projects for school and want to keep going (actual projects, not learning).

**Thoughts:** Met up with Hailey and Ruby from LaunchCode and had a successful work session at Grand Central Bakery on Fremont. It's a pretty good place to work in the afternoon. Very quiet, and a nice big table. I worked for a couple of hours at home by myself later in the evening.

It can be very overwhelming to try to work on a big project without breaking it down into tiny steps, so I've been careful to implement one tiny part at a time, and test to see if it works. If I get an error, I remove what I just added, and break that down into smaller bits to see what is breaking it. This ends up giving me lots of little successes and motivates me to keep going, instead of coding for hours to find there are multiple errors that I can't untangle.

### July 2, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/OgvYZO), and messed around with my Kirby installation.

**Thoughts:** Getting a bit quicker making these. In addition to the CodePen, I spent around an hour today reading and watching videos on CSS units. There is a lot I didn't properly understand, so I'm glad I took the time to do that.

### July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/OgQQeB/). This was an experiment in getting Flexbox to work properly, and trying to flip something back to front.

**Thoughts:** I cheated a bit and used opacity to hide the front/back of the circles as they turned. I'm hoping to be able to figure out how to do this with [backface-visibility](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_backface-visibility.asp) instead.

### June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/ZyvERv). I was attempting to use Flexbox, but that didn't turn out so well.

**Thoughts:** I'm not super thrilled with what I can up with today. I need to do some concentrated reading on Flexbox tomorrow (before I start coding), and give that another try. I have no idea what I was doing wrong, but I'm determined to work on something every day and post progress, even when I don't like it. I also want to look into how to apply multiple CSS animations (or transitions?) to one element.

**Resources:** 

1. [Animation Shorthand Cheat Sheet](https://codepen.io/tatimblin/pen/egBpwR): I didn't end up using the shorthand in the final version (it was causing a probem with my delay), but this helped me understand it

### June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/bRYBNO). Practicing again with :nth-child, and also delayed animation.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun putting this one together. It's also great to see my animations start stacking up after working on it consistently every day. I can't wait to see 100 animations in my CodePen. Definitely a treat to be doing this after a day of working on MySQL for my [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/lc101) class.

### June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBxJb), heavily inspired by the header of the Creative Mornings weekly newsletter.

**Thoughts:** I'm sure what I did still isn't even close to the most efficient way of doing this, but using :nth-child is a new approach for me. When I started, I thought I'd give each of the divs an individual class, but with using :nth-child I could save that time and create generic divs for each of the circles. I'm excited about some of the new gradient techniques I learned today. I might go back to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients) tomorrow to try something new.

### June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBbBo). It's blazing hot this weekend, so I made a radiating sun animation. I skimmed the rest of the Pocket Guide to CSS Animations, and read some articles. I also researched CMS's for a new domain, and installed [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) to try it out.

**Thoughts:** Another semi-frustrating day with CSS Animations. I tried to do a sun to moon sunset type of thing that didn't work out (design-wise). I'm happy with what I made though, because I've seen that radiating kind of thing before, and I was able to duplicate it without looking at source code. I guess I'm just looking forward to the day I can work on more complicated animations. :)

### June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I reacquainted myself with CSS animation and started some work on CodePen. I made a little circle animation with some text underneath.

**Thoughts:** I tried for a long time to make the text under the circle [flip](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip) to say hi/bye, but was unsuccessful. I will try this again another time. I am happy with the color blending however.
