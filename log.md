# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Day 3: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBxJb), heavily inspired by the header of the Creative Mornings weekly newsletter.

**Thoughts:** I'm sure what I did still isn't even close to the most efficient way of doing this, but using :nth-child is a new approach for me. When I started, I thought I'd give each of the divs an individual class, but with using :nth-child I could save that time and create generic divs for each of the circles. I'm excited about some of the new gradient techniques I learned today. I might go back to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients) tomorrow to try something new.

### Day 2: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBbBo). It's blazing hot this weekend, so I made a radiating sun animation. I skimmed the rest of the Pocket Guide to CSS Animations, and read some articles. I also researched CMS's for a new domain, and installed [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) to try it out.

**Thoughts:** Another semi-frustrating day with CSS Animations. I tried to do a sun to moon sunset type of thing that didn't work out (design-wise). I'm happy with what I made though, because I've seen that radiating kind of thing before, and I was able to duplicate it without looking at source code. I guess I'm just looking forward to the day I can work on more complicated animations. :)

### Day 1: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I reacquainted myself with CSS animation and started some work on CodePen. I made a little circle animation with some text underneath.

**Thoughts:** I tried for a long time to make the text under the circle [flip](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip) to say hi/bye, but was unsuccessful. I will try this again another time. I am happy with the color blending however.
