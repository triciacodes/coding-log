### September 4â€“6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on my last project for my Creative Coding class at PCC. We did presentations on Sept 7. I used the [Leap Motion for Processing](https://github.com/nok/leap-motion-processing) library to make the graphics responsive to hand motion and gestures. I also made each of the interactions available by using the keyboard.

### September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the problems in Codecademy's updated [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course. Some of the [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) are covered in this course, so some of this is new knowledge. Notably: let, const, arrow syntax.

### September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Restarting the challenge again. I've been steadily working on both JavaScript and Processing, but I haven't been consistently pushing work to Github. I haven't found a good way to post my Processing sketches online without resorting to using gifs. I may switch to using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) so that I can publish the sketches on my website. Today I worked on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) 30 Days of Code challenges, and the todo list exercise from the [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com) course. I'm happy to report that I'm able to work ahead somewhat within each section. After I finish working through the tutorial, I'm planning on trying to duplicate the project independently.

### July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was learning how to create 3D shapes with [Processing](https://processing.org/), and I came up with [this](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a) shimmery sort of gradient box, halfway through intention, and halfway through happy accident.
