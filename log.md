# 100 Days Of Code Log

### Day 6: July 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/OgQQeB/). This was an experiment in getting Flexbox to work properly, and trying to flip something back to front.

**Thoughts:** I cheated a bit and used opacity to hide the front/back of the circles as they turned. I'm hoping to be able to figure out how to do this with [backface-visibility](https://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_backface-visibility.asp) instead.

**Resources:** 

1. [Create a CSS Flipping Animation](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip): I used some parts of this for the flipping
2. [Using backface-visibility and CSS Animations](https://designmodo.com/backface-visibility-css-animation/): I'm going to check this one out tomorrow

### Day 5: June 27, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/ZyvERv). I was attempting to use Flexbox, but that didn't turn out so well.

**Thoughts:** I'm not super thrilled with what I can up with today. I need to do some concentrated reading on Flexbox tomorrow (before I start coding), and give that another try. I have no idea what I was doing wrong, but I'm determined to work on something every day and post progress, even when I don't like it. I also want to look into how to apply multiple CSS animations (or transitions?) to one element.

**Resources:** 

1. [Animation Shorthand Cheat Sheet](https://codepen.io/tatimblin/pen/egBpwR): I didn't end up using the shorthand in the final version (it was causing a probem with my delay), but this helped me understand it
2. [A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/): I'm going to start again with this tutorial tomorrow

### Day 4: June 26, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished another [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/bRYBNO). Practicing again with :nth-child, and also delayed animation.

**Thoughts:** I had a lot of fun putting this one together. It's also great to see my animations start stacking up after working on it consistently every day. I can't wait to see 100 animations in my CodePen. Definitely a treat to be doing this after a day of working on MySQL for my [LaunchCode](https://www.launchcode.org/lc101) class.

**Resources:** 

1. [Moving an element along a circle](http://lea.verou.me/2012/02/moving-an-element-along-a-circle/) by [Lea Verou](http://lea.verou.me/): My animation started from this tutorial
2. [Quiver](http://happenapps.com/): I've been using this app for notetaking <3
3. [Mastering the :nth-child](http://nthmaster.com/): Needed a MAJOR refresher on this

### Day 3: June 25, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBxJb), heavily inspired by the header of the Creative Mornings weekly newsletter.

**Thoughts:** I'm sure what I did still isn't even close to the most efficient way of doing this, but using :nth-child is a new approach for me. When I started, I thought I'd give each of the divs an individual class, but with using :nth-child I could save that time and create generic divs for each of the circles. I'm excited about some of the new gradient techniques I learned today. I might go back to the [MDN documentation](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/CSS_Images/Using_CSS_gradients) tomorrow to try something new.

### Day 2: June 24, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished a new [CodePen](https://codepen.io/tricialeach/pen/mwBbBo). It's blazing hot this weekend, so I made a radiating sun animation. I skimmed the rest of the Pocket Guide to CSS Animations, and read some articles. I also researched CMS's for a new domain, and installed [Kirby](https://getkirby.com/) to try it out.

**Thoughts:** Another semi-frustrating day with CSS Animations. I tried to do a sun to moon sunset type of thing that didn't work out (design-wise). I'm happy with what I made though, because I've seen that radiating kind of thing before, and I was able to duplicate it without looking at source code. I guess I'm just looking forward to the day I can work on more complicated animations. :)

### Day 1: June 23, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I reacquainted myself with CSS animation and started some work on CodePen. I made a little circle animation with some text underneath.

**Thoughts:** I tried for a long time to make the text under the circle [flip](https://davidwalsh.name/css-flip) to say hi/bye, but was unsuccessful. I will try this again another time. I am happy with the color blending however.
