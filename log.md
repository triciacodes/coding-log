### October 10, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Finished the design draft for my personal portfolio website. Installed [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/), updated Ruby, and installed [Sass](http://sass-lang.com/install). Set up initial starter template for portfolio website, including Sass file. Tested to ensure it was working. This is what I need to use in terminal: $sass --watch --style expanded scss/styles.scss:styles/main.css

### October 9, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Started coding the Friends of Graphic Design website again. The last version (started/stopped a year ago) utilized floats for layout, and wasn't fully completed. I stripped out the floats and converted to using Bootstrap for layout. After getting into the more creative aspects of the layout (photos that go off the side of page, backgrounds that are diagonal), I realized the way I'm using Bootstrap might not be the best setup for this layout. Additionally, it complicates the HTML with a lot of divs. And, it's unlikely that most students who will be updating the website will know Bootstrap. I'm trying to strike a compromise between creating this website quickly, and using technology that students with more limited knowledge will be able to update. Flexbox with great comments may be the way to go.

### September 4â€“6, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I've been working on my last project for my Creative Coding class at PCC. We did presentations on Sept 7. I used the [Leap Motion for Processing](https://github.com/nok/leap-motion-processing) library to make the graphics responsive to hand motion and gestures. I also made each of the interactions available by using the keyboard.

### September 3, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Working through the problems in Codecademy's updated [Introduction to JavaScript](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/introduction-to-javascript) course. Some of the [ES6 features](https://github.com/lukehoban/es6features) are covered in this course, so some of this is new knowledge. Notably: let, const, arrow syntax.

### September 1, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Restarting the challenge again. I've been steadily working on both JavaScript and Processing, but I haven't been consistently pushing work to Github. I haven't found a good way to post my Processing sketches online without resorting to using gifs. I may switch to using [p5.js](https://p5js.org/) so that I can publish the sketches on my website. Today I worked on [HackerRank](https://www.hackerrank.com) 30 Days of Code challenges, and the todo list exercise from the [Practical JavaScript](https://watchandcode.com) course. I'm happy to report that I'm able to work ahead somewhat within each section. After I finish working through the tutorial, I'm planning on trying to duplicate the project independently.

### July 20, 2017

**Today's Progress**: I was learning how to create 3D shapes with [Processing](https://processing.org/), and I came up with [this](https://github.com/tricialeach/processing/tree/master/sketch_170720a) shimmery sort of gradient box, halfway through intention, and halfway through happy accident.
